# Charter-school-identities
Data and code related to my dissertation research on charter school identities as analyzed from mission statements (MSs) on their public websites. At present this research is cross-sectional, looking at the population of currently open U.S. charter schools, but plans are in the works to get longitudinal MS data using the Internet Archive.
