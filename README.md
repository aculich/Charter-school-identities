# Charter-school-identities
Data and code related to my dissertation research on charter school identities as analyzed from mission statements (MSs) on their public websites. Most of the code is in Python 3 and delivered as Jupyter Notebooks.

Identities will be categorized using text analytic methods including Natural Language Processing (NLP; e.g., distinctive words, concordances), custom dictionaries, and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Structural Topic Models). The next step after that is to use statistical regression to connect identity patterns with community characteristics (e.g., class, race, political leanings).

At present this research is cross-sectional, looking at the population of currently open U.S. charter schools, but plans are in the works to get longitudinal MS data using the Internet Archive. These data will be used to examine survival and geographic dispersion of the different identity categories over time.
