# Stratification through organizational identity:
## Do charter schools' ideologies reinforce social inequalities?

This repo is for data and code related to my dissertation research on charter school identities as analyzed from mission statements (MSs) on their public websites. The code is in Python 3 Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

I will categorize identities using text analytic methods including Natural Language Processing (NLP; e.g., distinctive words, concordances), custom dictionaries, and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Structural Topic Models, Word Embeddings). The next step after that is to use statistical regression to connect identity patterns with community characteristics (e.g., class, race, political leanings).

At present this research is cross-sectional, looking at the population of currently open U.S. charter schools, but plans are in the works to get longitudinal MS data using the Internet Archive. I will use these data to examine survival and geographic dispersion of the different identity categories over time.

For lots more details on my data and method, see my [April 2017 pre-registration with the Open Science Foundation](https://osf.io/zgh5u/), especially the [Prereg Challenge form](https://osf.io/zgh5u/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67).
