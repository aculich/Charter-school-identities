We opened our doors in 2005 and continue to grow serving more and more students each year. WCS’s primary mission is to demonstrate what is possible when school and community collaborate to create inspiring adults with the academic and social-emotional readiness to lead as Global Citizens.  Westlake Charter School students are EXPLORERS! Our curriculum focuses on diversity and appreciation of different cultures, while promoting academic excellence and foreign language acquisition. We offer various specialty classes to all of our students including Art, Physical Education, and Spanish. Our middle school program focuses on Math, Science and Technology and is executed through the use of technology. Westlake Charter School has small class sizes of approximately 22-24 students in K-3rd grade and 29 students in 4th-8th grade.  First time visitors to Westlake Charter School often remark, “What a warm and inviting school!” Creating a school that is caring and open is absolutely critical in working successfully with our children and families. Students who feel safe, secure, and appreciated gain a love of learning and will be successful scholars.  Westlake Charter School’s professional staff is relentless in seeking and trying research-based best practices that engage every student. Our lessons are hands-on and differentiated to meet the diverse needs of all students. Our teachers display a never-ending commitment to improving their own expertise. Furthermore, we would not be as successful without the support and involvement of our parents. Our parent group is outstanding in helping us achieve our goals by volunteering their time in class, fundraising for our unique programs, and providing endless words of encouragement and support.

What is Dual Enrollment?   Dual Enrollment is taking college classes while you are still in high school. Sometimes these classes can also count toward high school credits.  These courses can save you thousands of dollars in tuition costs;  And shorten the time it takes to earn a college degree.   Each year, hundreds of dedicated high school students take these courses through MTC’s Dual Enrollment program, and get a jump-start on their college education!  There are a few different options:   Work with your school to get approval to come to MTC and take Dual Enrollment classes on one of our six regional campuses.  Find out if you’re in a district where MTC faculty are already teaching courses in your high school.  Take Dual Enrollment courses that are available online.   Please see your high school guidance counselor to find out which option is best for you.  Who is Eligible?  If you are currently a high school junior or senior in the Midlands, then you are eligible to enroll in Dual Enrollment courses as long as you meet placement testing requirements. To be accepted into the Dual Enrollment program:   Apply to MTC using the Dual Enrollment Online Application .  Complete the Placement Test and place into the courses you wish to take.  Receive permission from high school principal/guidance counselor and parents.   Tuition and Fees  Students enrolled in MTC Dual Enrollment classes held at their high schools are responsible for the cost of their books. The cost of tuition and fees for MTC classes held on high school campuses is coordinated between the college and school district.  Students who enroll in courses held on MTC campuses are responsible for the cost of tuition, fees, and books.  *** If you take at least six college credit hours during a semester, that may reduce your tuition greatly by receiving South Carolina Lottery Tuition Assistance. ***  We’ll help you through the financial aid process, and you can find more information on the Lottery Tuition Assistance form .  What are the Advantages of Dual Enrollment courses?

Classes are offered through the internet. We have partnered with Richland School District Two to provide your classes via the Virtual High School already established within the district. Students have access to our full-time English teacher, math tutor, and lab specialist.   Can I finish one subject area before starting another?  Your core classes will be tailored to your learning style with help from our highly certified teachers and staff to meet your learning needs. If that is how you learn best, then you can complete one class before taking the next.   How many students are you accepting?  We can enroll a maximum of 20 freshman, 20 sophomores, 40 juniors, and 40 seniors. (120 students maximum.) If there are more than 120 applicants then students will be chosen by lottery.   Do I pay tuition to attend the Richland Two Charter High School?  There is absolutely no tuition for attending Richland Two Charter High School.   What are the graduation requirements at the Richland Two Charter High School?  In addition to the South Carolina graduation requirements, all students must complete the entire sequence of the \"Leadership and Development\" courses, which are designed to provide soft skills training and offer internship opportunities. This course sequence must be completed in order to be eligible to graduate from the Richland Two Charter High School.   Will I get paid for my internship programs?  Some programs may have a salary associated with them, however, we do not guarantee that you will be paid for your internships.   Will I graduate with my class at my old high school?  You will be awarded a South Carolina High School Diploma upon your graduation and will graduate with the students at the Richland Two Charter High School, not at the high school that you were previously zoned for.
